\section{Introduction}

The dataset is available on the UCI website \url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality} There are 2 datasets. One for white wine and one for red wine. This paper focuses on the white wine dataset. The dataset holds the following features

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Fixed acidity 
  \item Volatile acidity
  \item Citric acid 
  \item Residual sugar 
  \item Chlorides
  \item Free sulfur dioxide 
  \item Total sulfur dioxide 
  \item Density
  \item PH
  \item Sulphates
  \item Alcohol
  \item Quality (score between 0 and 10)
\end{enumerate}

This project aims to create a classification model for predicting the quality of white wine. This ranges from 0 to 10, 0 being the worst and 10 being the best quality wine.
