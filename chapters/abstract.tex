This paper aims to evaluate a popular dataset from UCI known as the Wine Quality data set. The dataset is split into 2 parts. One for red wine and one for white wine. This paper is concerned only with the white wine dataset. The dataset is composed of 12 features and 4898 instances of data. The dataset can be used for both regression and classification problems, however, this paper will focus on classification.

The main goal is to create a classification model of wine quality based on a set of features. The results of the classification are very good with accuracy ranging from 96\% to 97\% between Logistic Regression, Decision Tree classification and Random Forest classification
