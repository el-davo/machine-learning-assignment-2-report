\section{Abstract}

This paper aims to evaluate a popular dataset from UCI known as the Wine Quality data set. The dataset is split into 2 one for red wine and one for white wine. This paper is concerned only with the white wine dataset. The dataset is composed of 12 features and 4898 instances of data. The dataset can be used for both regression and classification problems however this paper will focus on regression.

The main goal is to create a predictive model of wine quality based on a set of features. The features are outlined below

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Fixed acidity 
  \item Volatile acidity
  \item Citric acid 
  \item Residual sugar 
  \item Chlorides
  \item Free sulfur dioxide 
  \item Total sulfur dioxide 
  \item Density
  \item PH
  \item Sulphates
  \item Alcohol
  \item Quality (score between 0 and 10)
\end{enumerate}

We will be trying to predict the quality feature. This ranges from 0 to 10, 0 being the worst and 10 being the best quality wine.
