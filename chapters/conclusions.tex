\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

\subsection{Conclusion}

As the aim of this paper was to generate a classification model for the white wine dataset. I feel I have achieved this goal with an acceptable accuracy of over 95\%

\subsection{Future Work}

It is generally said that wine gets better with age. An interesting observation of this dataset is that it is missing the age of the wine. It would be interesting in the future to see how adding age to the dataset would affect the classification, or would it have any effect at all.
